countries too. It is popularly known as co-operative education and referred to
as sandwich in Europe. It is a six (6) months students industrial work
experience scheme (SIWES) taken in the third year of the degree program,
where the students go to various establishments related to their course of
study.</p>
                                            <p>The program was initially introduced in Nigeria by the Industrial Training
Fund (I.T.) which was established under Decree 47 of 1972 by the Supreme
Military Council, headed by General Yakubu Gowon. The Decree was billed
to take effect from 31st March, 1974 and had as its core objective, the gradual</p>

    equipment and machinery that are mostly not available in their various
    institutions.
 Provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge in real
    world situation thereby reducing the gap between theoretical
    knowledge and practical work.
 Enlist and strengthen employers’ involvement in the entire educational
    process and prepare students for employment in Industry and
    Commerce.</p>

                                            <p>The SIWES program expected to be undergone by all students in the school
of applied science in all tertiary institution in Nigeria.</p>
                                            <p>I therefore deeply appreciate the industrial training of my school (Kogi State
Polytechnic, Lokoja) for involving themselves in such a worldwide program.
The importance of this training cannot be over emphasized industrial training
by some operations carried out during the program.</p>

                                                <strong>5 RECOMMENDATION</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>I like to use this medium to explore the federal Government at all stage to
take this SIWES program more seriously seen by the students of applied
science as a virtual improvement in future of technology in our nature.</p>
                                            <p>Government should also ensure a proper supervision of SIWES student so
that the purpose of the programme will be achieved.</p>
                                            <p>The federal Government should make adequate provision in the annual
budget for proper funding of SIWES in view of the potential of the scheme to
contribute to enhancing the quality of the pool to technical skill available to
the economy.</p>
                                            <p>A comprehensive and detail directory of employer who accept students for
SIWES is urgently required to facilitate placement of student in industry.</p>
                                            <p>In order to guarantee quality assurance of institution and the ITF. The ITF
should ensure that the backlog in payment of students allowance is cleared
urgently to remove the negative image being created for SIWES.</p>
